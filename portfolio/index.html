              I'm Raffi Molero, but people call me Raf. I mostly make technical
              projects to test new/faster algorithms or play around with
              programming languages and simulations.

            <p>
              As it stands today, I have more experience doing frontend as you
              can see in my sample projects. Still, I think I would prefer doing
              backend, writing server logic and doing database queries and such.
              I love optimization, so I'm more attracted to anything that
              processes a lot of data or does a lot of logic.
            </p>
            <p>
              I like helping people code. I sometimes play guitar or tetris. I'm
              also a fan of VTubers ☄️

                  An entire templating engine built as my first PHP project. It
                  was built for fun, and to make it easier to submit a school
                  project with... interesting submission limitations.
                </p>
                <p>It's very rough. To quote the readme:</p>
                <div class="quote">
                  <p>
                    This is a project designed to comply with some really weird
                    specification set for a school project. Apparently we
                    weren't allowed to use the latest PHP features and had to
                    use PHP print statements to print out HTML, instead of just
                    putting the PHP inside of the HTML like it was designed to
                    do from the very moment it was created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, out of sheer spite, I decided to create a very extremely
                    rushed framework/build system that takes a file structure of
                    .php files with templates and styles, and compiles them into
                    a set of .html and .php files structured the same way as the
                    folder structure inside of Exer1Spec/php/views/**.

                    simulator, a bouncing rectangle, a dice game whose sprites
                    have since disappeared, tic tac toe but your opponent is
                    yourself, a tool to compute when you should play a song to
                    hit the drop at exactly 12:00 AM on new year, and a thing
                    that draws vector angles.

                    This is a Discord bot that I wrote in Rust and used to run
                    on my local machine that allows 2 players to play a board

                    One player sends a command to host a new lobby, another
                    player will join, and then both players choose a color
                    (Red/Blue). Then the game will be played and displayed as
                    text. It has buttons for players to make their move, and
                    supports resigning.

                  <p>
                    I've also made another Discord bot in Node.js, but I've

                    A game that's supposed to be about manipulating fractals and

                    with making a proper UI for the game. Maybe one day it will
                    have something good enough to play with.
