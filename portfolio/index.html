                I'm Raffi Molero, but people call me Raf. I mostly make
                technical projects to test new/faster algorithms or play around
                with programming languages and simulations. I've been
                programming for 7 years now, ever since the summer of 6th grade,
                and my first programming language was C# after Minecraft
                Commands.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it stands today, I have more experience doing frontend as you
                can see in my sample projects. Still, I think I would prefer
                doing backend, writing server logic and doing database queries
                and such. I love optimization, so I'm more attracted to anything
                that processes a lot of data or does a lot of logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                I like helping people code. I sometimes play guitar or tetris.
                I'm also a fan of VTubers ☄️

                    It includes minesweeper, snake, a weird cellular automaton
                    simulator, a bouncing rectangle, a dice game whose sprites
                    have since disappeared, tic tac toe but your opponent is
                    yourself, a tool to compute when you should play a song to
                    hit the drop at exactly 12:00 AM on new year, and a thing

                  An entire templating engine built as my first PHP project. It
                  was built for fun, and to make it easier to submit a school
                  project with... interesting submission limitations.
                </p>
                <p>It's very rough. To quote the readme:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    This is a project designed to comply with some really weird
                    specification set for a school project. Apparently we
                    weren't allowed to use the latest PHP features and had to
                    use PHP print statements to print out HTML, instead of just
                    putting the PHP inside of the HTML like it was designed to
                    do from the very moment it was created.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, out of sheer spite, I decided to create a very extremely
                    rushed framework/build system that takes a file structure of
                    .php files with templates and styles, and compiles them into
                    a set of .html and .php files structured the same way as the
                    folder structure inside of Exer1Spec/php/views/**.

                    One player sends a command to host a new lobby, another

                    (Red/Blue). Then the game will be played and displayed as
                    text. It has buttons for players to make their move, and
                    supports resigning.

                    A game that's supposed to be about manipulating fractals and

                    Built only because of my love of recursion, data structures,

                    with making a proper UI for the game. Maybe one day it will
                    have something good enough to play with.
